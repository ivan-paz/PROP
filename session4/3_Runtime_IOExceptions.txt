1. RuntimeException

A runtime exception happens due to a programming error. They are also known as unchecked exceptions.

These exceptions are not checked at compile-time but run-time. Some of the common runtime exceptions are:

e.g :

    Dividing a number by 0 - ArithmeticException

You can think about it in this way. “If it is a runtime exception, it is your fault”.


The NullPointerException would not have occurred if you had checked whether the variable was initialized or not before using it.

An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException would not have occurred if you tested the array index against the array bounds.




2. IOException

An IOException is also known as a checked exception. They are checked by the compiler at the compile-time and the programmer is prompted to handle these exceptions.

Some of the examples of checked exceptions are:

    Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist results in FileNotFoundException
    Trying to read past the end of a file
